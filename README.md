# Conclave Whitepaper

Official repository for the Conclave whitepaper.

Currently there are two whitepapers: Noel's original university thesis which is rather long and convoluted (but complete), and a newer, more streamlined whitepaper containing new updated ideas.

## Building

To build the original thesis:

```
cd thesis
make
```

To build the whitepaper:

```
cd whitepaper
make
```

## Viewing

Any PDF viewer will work but I like to use [Atril](https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril), as it watches for changes in the PDF file. You may not need this though.
